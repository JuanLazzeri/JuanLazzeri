## About Myself
Hi! My name is Juan Lazzeri but you can call me Juj or Escobar.
I'm new here, for now.
I am a music-driven Information Technology student who is looking for experiences and to build solid projects that reflect my commitment to always seeking to develop myself.
- ‚úè  I'm currently studying HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, SQL and Delphi while I'm studying systems analysis and development. Intend to deepen my knowledge of Full Stack, starting with Python and, probably, Machine Learning.
- üèóÔ∏è I will post here some ongoing projects and studies.
